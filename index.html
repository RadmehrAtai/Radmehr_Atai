                demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the <strong>natural
                    intelligence</strong>
                displayed by animals including humans. Leading <abbr>AI</abbr> textbooks define the field as the study
                of
                "intelligent agents":
            <blockquote>
                Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its
                goals.<sup>[a]</sup> Some
                popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive"
                functions
                that
                humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving", however this definition
                is
                rejected
                by major <abbr>AI</abbr> researchers.<sup>[b]</sup></blockquote>

            <p><abbr>AI</abbr> applications include advanced web search engines (i.e. Google), recommendation systems
                (used
                by
                YouTube, Amazon
                and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla),
                automated
                decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and
                Go).<cite> <sup>[2]</sup> </cite>
                As machines
                become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
                definition of
                <abbr>AI</abbr>,
                a phenomenon known as the <abbr>AI</abbr> effect.<cite> <sup>[3]</sup> </cite> For instance, optical
                character
                recognition is
                frequently

            <p> Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in
                antiquity,<cite><sup>[17]</sup></cite> and have been
                common in
                fiction, as in <em>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</em> or <em>Karel Čapek's
                    R.U.R</em>.<cite><sup>[18]</sup></cite>
                These
                characters and their
                fates
                raised many
                of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.<cite><sup>[19]</sup></cite>
            </p>

            <p> The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.
                The
                study
                of
                mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine,
                by
                shuffling
                symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This
                insight,
                that
                digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing
                thesis.<cite><sup>[20]</sup></cite>

            <p dir="ltr"> The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into
                sub-problems.
                These
                consist
                of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The
                traits
                described
                below have received the most attention.<sup>[c]</sup></p>

            <h3>Reasoning, problem solving</h3>

            <p dir="ltr"> Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use
                when
                they
                solve
                puzzles
                or make logical deductions.<cite> <sup>[45]</sup> </cite> By the late 1980s and 1990s, <abbr>AI</abbr>
                research
                had developed
                methods for
                dealing with
                uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and
                economics.<cite><sup>[46]</sup></cite></p>

            <p dir="ltr"> Many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems
                because
                they
                experienced
                a
                "combinatorial explosion":
            <blockquote> They became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<cite><sup>[47]</sup></cite> Even
                humans
                rarely use
                the step-by-step deduction that early <abbr>AI</abbr> research could model. They solve most of their
                problems
                using fast,
                intuitive judgments.<cite><sup>[48]</sup></cite>

            <h3> Search and optimization </h3>
            <p> Many problems in <abbr>AI</abbr> can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many
                possible
                solutions:<cite><sup>[91]</sup></cite>
                Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching
                for a
                path
                that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference
                rule.<cite><sup>[92]</sup></cite>
                Planning
                algorithms search through trees of goals and sub-goals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a
                process
                called
                means-ends analysis.<cite><sup>[93]</sup></cite>Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping
                objects
                use
                local searches
                in
                configuration space.<cite><sup>[94]</sup></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simple exhaustive searches<cite> <sup>[95]</sup> </cite> are rarely sufficient for most real-world
                problems:
                the
                search space (the number
                of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or
                never
                completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use "heuristics" or "rules of thumb" that prioritize
                choices
                in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search
                methodologies heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called
                "pruning
                the search tree"). Heuristics supply the program with a "best guess" for the path on which the solution
                lies.<cite><sup>[96]</sup></cite> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample
                size.<cite><sup>[97]</sup></cite>
