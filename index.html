    <p><strong>Artificial intelligence (<abbr>AI</abbr>) </strong> is <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"
            target="_blank">
        intelligence</a>
        demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the <strong>natural
            intelligence</strong>
        displayed by animals including humans. Leading <abbr>AI</abbr> textbooks define the field as the study of
        "intelligent agents":
    <blockquote>
        Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its
        goals.<sup>[a]</sup> Some
        popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions
        that
        humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving", however this definition is
        rejected
        by major <abbr>AI</abbr> researchers.<sup>[b]</sup></blockquote>

    <p><abbr>AI</abbr> applications include advanced web search engines (i.e. Google), recommendation systems (used by
        YouTube, Amazon
        and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla), automated
        decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and
        Go).<cite> <sup>[2]</sup> </cite>
        As machines
        become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of
        <abbr>AI</abbr>,
        a phenomenon known as the <abbr>AI</abbr> effect.<cite> <sup>[3]</sup> </cite> For instance, optical character
        recognition is
        frequently
        excluded from
        things considered to be <abbr>AI</abbr>,<cite> <sup>[4]</sup> </cite> having become a routine
        technology.<cite> <sup>[5]</sup> </cite>

    <p> Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,<sup>[17]</sup> and have been
        common in
        fiction, as in <em>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</em> or <em>Karel Čapek's R.U.R</em>.<sup>[18]</sup> These
        characters and their
        fates
        raised many
        of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.<sup>[19]</sup></p>

    <p> The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study
        of
        mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by
        shuffling
        symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight,
        that
        digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing
        thesis.<sup>[20]</sup>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p> The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These
        consist
        of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits
        described
        below have received the most attention.<sup>[c]</sup></p>

    <h3>Reasoning, problem solving</h3>

    <p> Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve
        puzzles
        or make logical deductions.<sup>[45]</sup> By the late 1980s and 1990s, <abbr>AI</abbr> research had developed
        methods for
        dealing with
        uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.<sup>[46]</sup></p>

    <p> Many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced
        a
        "combinatorial explosion":
    <blockquote> They became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<sup>[47]</sup> Even humans
        rarely use
        the step-by-step deduction that early <abbr>AI</abbr> research could model. They solve most of their problems
        using fast,
        intuitive judgments.<sup>[48]</sup>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <h3> Search and optimization </h3>
    <p> Many problems in <abbr>AI</abbr> can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible
        solutions:<sup>[91]</sup>
        Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a
        path
        that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.<sup>[92]</sup>
        Planning
        algorithms search through trees of goals and sub-goals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process
        called
        means-ends analysis.<sup>[93]</sup> Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches
        in
        configuration space.<sup>[94]</sup>
